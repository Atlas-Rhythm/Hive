# Hive

A general backend project for modding communities.

## Building

### Dependencies

- Visual Studio >= 16.6
  - If not on Visual Studio Preview 2 or later, enable `.NET Core Preview` from `Tools/Options/Environment/Preview Features`

### PostgreSQL

- PostgreSQL >= 12.0
- Add a connection string with the name `Default` to your project secrets of Hive. This should be used for connecting to 
  Hive's specific database.

### Visual Studio Intellisense

Visual Studio may complain about certain things if you start it without first building the code generator.
To make sure intellisense is functional, run `dotnet build` before opening Visual Studio. It may also just
not work if you're not running the latest preview.
