# Permissions Rules

A key component to Hive is its permission system, and the rules that govern it.

This page is for the configuration of Hive's permission system. [Here is the documentation for the permissions system itself.](https://github.com/Atlas-Rhythm/Hive/blob/master/Hive.Permissions/docs/Usage.md).

## `RuleSubfolder` - string

This determines the subfolder in the Hive installation folder where permission rules will be read from. By default, this is set to a `Rules` subfolder.
